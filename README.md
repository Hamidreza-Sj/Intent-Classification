# Intent-Classification
This repository includes the following files:

- development.csv: A development set consisting of 9,854 recording features with corresponding labels.
- evaluation.csv: An evaluation set comprising 1,455 recording features.
- prediction.csv: Contains the predictions generated by the LightGBM model (the best-performing algorithm).

In this repository, two famous ML algorithms Random Forest and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) are implemented to make intent classifiers on a dataset with 7 classes. You can find the code for all these algorithms in main.ipynb. You can find the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hamidrezasj/intent-classification-dataset
